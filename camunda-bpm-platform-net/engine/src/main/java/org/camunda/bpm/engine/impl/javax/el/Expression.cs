	/// Base class for the expression subclasses <seealso cref="ValueExpression"/> and <seealso cref="MethodExpression"/>,

	/// hashCode() methods so that two expressions can be compared for equality. They are redefined
	/// abstract in this class to force their implementation in subclasses. All expressions must also be
	/// Serializable so that they can be saved and restored. Expressions are also designed to be
	/// immutable so that only one instance needs to be created for any given expression String /
	/// <seealso cref="FunctionMapper"/>. This allows a container to pre-create expressions and not have to reparse
	/// them each time they are evaluated.
