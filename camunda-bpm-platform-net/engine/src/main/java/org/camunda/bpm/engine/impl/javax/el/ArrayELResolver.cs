	/// Defines property resolution behavior on arrays. This resolver handles base objects that are Java
	/// language arrays. It accepts any object as a property and coerces that object into an integer
	/// index into the array. The resulting value is the value in the array at that index. This resolver
	/// can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that isReadOnly will always return true and
	/// <seealso cref="setValue(ELContext, object, object, object)"/> will always throw
	/// PropertyNotWritableException. ELResolvers are combined together using <seealso cref="CompositeELResolver"/>
	/// s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression. See the javadocs for <seealso cref="ELResolver"/>
	/// for details.
